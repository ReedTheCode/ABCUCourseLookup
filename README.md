# ABCUCourseLookup

<h1>Summary</h1>
This project is a command-line course lookup application written in C++, developed to demonstrate the practical use of data structures and algorithms. This course used a fictional education entity to engage in a real-world solutioning process.
This project highlights the ability to work with structured data, implement searching and sorting logic, and reasona bout performance trade-offs when selecting the appropriate data structure.

In the scenario the institution required an application capable of loading course data from a file and allowing users to interactively retrieve and view course information.

The application presents a CLI menu that allows the user to:
<ul>
  <li>Load course data from a file</li>
  <li>Display an alphanumeric list of all Computer Science courses</li>
  <li>Search for and display detaile dinformation about a specific course</li>
  <li>Exit the application</li>
</ul>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
The most challenging aspect of this project was selecting and implementing an appropriate data structure to balance performance and simplicity. The searching and sorting requirements forced me to carefully consider the complexities of time and program behavior as data scales.

Another challenge was ensuring that the file input formatting did not break prerequisite matching, which required trimming input tokens and validating relationships between courses.

While these challenges took time to figure a solution, they helped reinforce the importance of defining appropriate data structures in programming and engage in thoughtful data validation when working with external data sources.
